### Linear List 
A Linear list _l_ is a set of all nodes $$N = {n_1, n_2, n_3, ..., n_k}$$, where k >= 0. If k = 0 then l is void. Else l is pointing to header's list, that is, where the list begins and the way we will run through depends upon the implementation

### implementation
We can implement as a contiguous or linked data structure according to our needs and  if they are based on arrays or pointers.
-   contiguously: A single chunk of memory is allocated for a structure of pre-determined size. 
-   Linked: composed of distinct chunks of memory allocated dynamically as the structure grows.
